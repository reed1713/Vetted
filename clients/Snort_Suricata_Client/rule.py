""" Module for parsing Snort-like rules.
Parsing is done using regular expressions and the job of this module
is to do its best at parsing out fields of interest from the rule
rather than perform a sanity check.
The methods that parse multiple rules for a provided input
(parse_file, parse_fileobj) return a list of rules instead of dict
keyed by ID as its not the job of this module to detect or deal with
duplicate signature IDs.
